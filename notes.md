First download Gradle 

*set a GRADLE_HOME environment variable

* download git bash if not installed

*to check if gradle installed or not-> got to command prompt or git bash and do -> `gradle -version`

* now clone this directory

* go to the root folder

* now enter command -> `gradle cleanIdea idea`

//// this command will installed all the dependencies required for the project to run under intellij

* now a ipr file would be created in the root directory: -> 
open this ipr file with command -> `open javaappintellij.ipr`

* now the project will automatically be opened in intellij

* run a gradle build command once :-:> command -> `gradle clean build`

now run the application from the main method. or with the command 

// The application does not contains any controller package 
for your practise you can try writing controller methods
//to check if any service is running check and run the test method in test package and see if they pass or not
